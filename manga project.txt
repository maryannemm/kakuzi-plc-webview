Given that you're a solo developer, it's crucial to consider your own expertise, development speed, and the ease of maintaining the project in the long run. Here's a simplified recommendation:

1. **Frontend: Flutter/Dart:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Easier learning curve if you're already familiar with it.
     - Single codebase for various platforms.
     - Flutter's rich widget library is suitable for complex UIs.

   - **Cons:**
     - May need to learn Dart if you're not already familiar.

2. **Backend: Python/Django:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Rapid development with Django.
     - Python is widely used and has a vast community.

   - **Cons:**
     - Might not be as performant for highly computational tasks.

3. **Image Processing/Performance-Intensive Tasks: C++:**
   - **Pros:**
     - Excellent performance for computationally intensive tasks.
     - Suitable for building high-performance libraries.

   - **Cons:**
     - Steeper learning curve and manual memory management.

**Recommended Approach:**
   - Start with Flutter/Dart for the frontend to leverage its advantages in UI development and cross-platform compatibility.

   - Use Python/Django for the backend, especially for rapid development and given your familiarity.

   - For performance-critical tasks (like image processing), consider implementing those in C++ and exposing them through APIs that the Python backend can call.

This approach allows you to balance development speed with performance where needed, considering your current proficiency and the solo development nature of the project.
